/**
 * Decodes canonical prefix code.
 * <p>
 * Notes on prefix code decoding:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Width of a tree node is defined as 2<sup>-d</sup>, where {@code d} is depth of that node. A prefix tree is said
 * to be complete iff all leaf widths sum to 1. If this sum is less (greater) than 1, we say the tree is incomplete
 * (oversubscribed). See also: Kraft's inequality.
 * <li>In this implementation, malformed trees (oversubscribed or incomplete) aren't rejected directly at creation
 * (that's the moment when both bad cases are detected). Instead, invalid trees cause decode error only when they are
 * actually used to decode a group. This is nonconforming behavior &ndash; the original <em>bzip2</em>, which serves as
 * a reference implementation, accepts malformed trees as long as nonexistent codes don't appear in compressed stream.
 * Neither bzip2 nor any alternative implementation I know produces such trees, so this behavior seems sane.
 * <li>When held in variables, codes are usually in left-justified form, meaning that they occupy consecutive most
 * significant bits of the variable they are stored in, while less significant bits of variable are padded with zeroes.
 * <p>
 * Such form allows for easy lexicographical comparison of codes using unsigned arithmetic comparison operators, without
 * the need for normalization.

     * Prefix code decoding is performed using a multilevel table lookup. The fastest way to decode is to simply build a
     * lookup table whose size is determined by the longest code. However, the time it takes to build this table can
     * also be a factor if the data being decoded is not very long. The most common codes are necessarily the shortest
     * codes, so those codes dominate the decoding time, and hence the speed. The idea is you can have a shorter table
     * that decodes the shorter, more probable codes, and then point to subsidiary tables for the longer codes. The time
     * it costs to decode the longer codes is then traded against the time it takes to make longer tables.
     * <p>
     * This result of this trade are in this constant. {@code HUFF_START_WIDTH} is the number of bits the first level
     * table can decode in one step. Subsequent tables always decode one bit at time. The current value of
     * {@code HUFF_START_WIDTH} was determined with a series of benchmarks. The optimum value may differ though from
     * machine to machine, and possibly even between compilers. Your mileage may vary.
