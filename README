Planned features
----------------

In order of descending priority:

  * Low level API for bzip2 compression and decompression, capable of
    manipulating single bzip2 blocks.

  * High level stream compression and decompression API, implementing
    InputStream and OutputStream filters.

  * Indexer for bz2 files and API providing random access to indexed
    bz2 files.

  * Command line utility, compatible with lbzip2 interface.
